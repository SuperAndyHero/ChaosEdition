more codes overall
santa too common (twice in first few min)
no color inverts in first few min
there needs to be a chance system for fine tuning
tile breaks too common (makes npc housing inpossible, avoid nearby npcs?)
struck by falling star effect
boss gated effects
add effect where a random player from the saved players joins the game
redo system so that extra delay isnt relied on (and/or add a (per code optional) recent codes / cooldown list to prevent dupes of ones that need a cooldown)
also maybe split CodeTypes array into per code type arrays, and add code type balacing (this may have been the intension since there are seperate active lists)
weighted random?
possibly a bool for if a code should be instant, if needed. As of now this can reply on time values
//TODO: request packet from client, send list of all active codes to client (figure out syncing custom data with codes)
//TODO find better hook for adding/removing codes, PostUpdateInput does not run on server
chest swap: null check
backup: SyncMultiplayerValues would instead use Attributes instead of user defined method
issue of desyncing values after effect activation (needs post resyncs, and/or defined seed)
figure out why EnemyHoming used Main.LocalPlayer.gravity = 0.5f;
copy screen minigames
enable confusion debuff
fix bouncytiles MP

3 or 4 effects are disabled in MP

DISABLE GRAVES!!!

To test in MP:
Santa(might use ran bool?)
DropHeldItemRandom(does not remove item, dupe)
AlwaysDropOneSlot(does not remove item, dupe)
DropCoinsRandom(does not remove item, dupe)
DropTombstoneRandom
MakeOneItemBait
ChristmasGift
ExplosiveDiarrhea
GrowTallPLants
TeleportEnemiesAroundPlayer
RandomTeleport (Host only, ran bool issue)
proj to critters(works, sometimes kills the creature)
BoulderDrop(no text)
Gravity (works, too short)
MultNpcSpeed (too long extra delay)
Unknown(too long extra delay)
freeze camera(too short)
invert screen(too annoying, maybe shorten, needs option)
lead to gold(make work on bars)
could scroll (too short)
small items(centering is broken, requested to keep as is)
weird item dupe when picking items with full inv, skipps can do it, I cant
item layer colors (alpha colors work)
explosive diarria(does nothing)
one of the UI scales (breaks all UI)
npc speed mult is broken?
lower gravity is too short, works
slime ghost (sometimes is too short)
place random torch (never seen it?)

broken:
RandomColors
ScrollingColors
any player effect with ran bool
dropping items dupe them
both that use GameUpdate % == 0 are broken

DONE many effects need sync attribute
DONE remove pick tile
DONE chance if wormhole into caves, welcome to the underground message
DONE idea: make one item very big
DONE make small items length shorter
DONE debug text on boulder (feedback says some warning text is good)
DONE idea: make santa drop bombs
DONE codes too fast
DONE debug text in mp if last slot is slime
