more codes overall
santa too common (twice in first few min)
no color inverts in first few min
there needs to be a chance system for fine tuning
tile breaks too common (makes npc housing inpossible, avoid nearby npcs?)
struck by falling star effect
boss gated effects
add effect where a random player from the saved players joins the game
redo system so that extra delay isnt relied on (and/or add a (per code optional) recent codes / cooldown list to prevent dupes of ones that need a cooldown)
also maybe split CodeTypes array into per code type arrays, and add code type balacing (this may have been the intension since there are seperate active lists)
weighted random?
possibly a bool for if a code should be instant, if needed. As of now this can reply on time values
//TODO: request packet from client, send list of all active codes to client (figure out syncing custom data with codes)
//TODO find better hook for adding/removing codes, PostUpdateInput does not run on server
chest swap: null check
backup: SyncMultiplayerValues would instead use Attributes instead of user defined method
issue of desyncing values after effect activation (needs post resyncs, and/or defined seed)

many effects need sync attribute

DONE remove pick tile
DONE chance if wormhole into caves, welcome to the underground message
DONE idea: make one item very big
DONE make small items length shorter
DONE debug text on boulder (feedback says some warning text is good)
DONE idea: make santa drop bombs
DONE codes too fast
